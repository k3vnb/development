Brainstorming:

Next biggest life challenge for me is transitioning from code school into getting a job in the tech industry, and to do well in this industry and progress and rise to satisfying roles over the course of 10 years.

I hope to secure a developer job within a year of graduating Epicodus. The timeline is less important to me than the steady trajectory in the direction of becoming a developer and being a part of the Portland tech community.  Upon graduating Epicodus I hope to devote my time and resources to: taking more classes, volunteering, practicing developing my own apps & websites, and building my network.

I am grateful for this project prompt, because it is something I've been thinking about myself, and something I've been chipping away at in my spare time, but its hard to get a solid 8 hour block to productively focus on these things.

#Areas needing improvement

##Non-technical Areas
  * Networking: In the past the idea of networking always seemed like a chore to me. This is mostly because I didn't have an interest in a field that made networking crucial. Now I have an interest in a field, and I have a basis of knowledge in that field, the idea of networking has actually become attractive to me. Beyond using networking as a job search tool, I am genuinely interested in connecting with interesting people working interesting projects. I am interested in contributing to the community.
  - I would like to create a business card w/ links to my Github & linkedIn profiles for distribution at meet-ups or wherever.
  * Contributing to society: We live in weird times. I want to contribute to the betterment of our society. One of the reasons I entered this field was because I realized I didn't have much to contribute previously, personally, professionally, or financially. Now I have a skillset that is powerful and applicable.
  * Public speaking & elevator pitch: I value a low-profile and non-interference in people's headspace. But I need to break out of my comfort zone and engage with people on occasion, and if I am going to do so, I should have the tools needed to make my presence an engaging one.
  * Staying focused: Like all of my generation, I'm easily distracted by shiny objects, or the potential thereof. Those shiny objects are almost always calling me from just behind the task at hand.

##Semi-technical
  * As a front-end web designer I think I have a decent eye for design. But I have no formal training in design, and when I venture into Reddit design message boards, for example, there seems to be a lot of loathing of those who think they're a designer without the training. While I don't expect I'm going to go through a whole professional training, I'd like to take in a few basic tutorials, so as not to identify myself as an amateur right off the bat.

##Technical
  * Algorithms: I need to practice algorithms, specifically with Javascript. This is for coding interview preparation, but also for generally being a better coder and having a better mindfulness for how information is transported and manipulated via code. I want to be comfortable seeing a puzzle prompt that takes an algorithm and having some intuitive sense of how to achieve the result with minimal code. I want to be able to verbalize my thought process both prior to writing the code and after.
  - Math. I haven't taken math classes in a long time, and I could use a refresher, with the intention of focusing on logic that pertains to the tech industry, but I think starting at geometry and Algebra 1 & 2 would be a significant help.
  - Data Science. There's a lot of info in this field, and at this point I think just an intro to the field would be beneficial.
  * READMEs: The more I visit other repositories, the more I realize how important a good README is. It is the front page of a repository, and it only takes a second or two to determine if spending time on this repository is worth the effort. I don't think my README game is terrible, but I'd like to get better at incorporating images and charts and other visually compelling information for potential visitors.

###Business card & Networking
I will devote the next 45 minutes to researching business card designs for web developers, creating a business card, maybe ordering a business card. This a part of the networking process, as I want to expand my network and have something to give people at meet-ups.

* Watched "5 tips for creating the perfect business card" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiXsDUcDims. Decent tips on both design & etiquette.

* Had a look at Creative Bloq's "10 Web designers' business card you'll want to keep" at https://www.creativebloq.com/features/10-web-designers-business-cards-youll-want-to-keep. Great looking cards, but a bit too gimicky or over-the-top for me at the moment.

* Good looking developer card templates at https://www.zazzle.com/web+developer+businesscards.

* I like the template here: https://creativemarket.com/mihaisrbn/4399-Web-Developer-Business-Card. The colors are visually appealing, but it also meaningful in that they correspond with a savvy text editor design. Appears to cost $5 to buy the template. I'm going to try to recreate my own in Canva.

Here is the card that was made:

* Networking: Watched "An Introvert's Guide to Networking" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPySGLL3gg. It emphasizes necessity to using networking events as networking, as in building a vast network of nodes, help others connect, don't just let it be a one way, what can you do for me kind of relationship building.  

Watched "10 Simple Ways to Improve your Networking Skills" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5xTbn6OnAA. Some good tips: come with a goal, initiate conversation (recommends opener 'hi, are you here for networking?'), be proactive about giving, connect people w/ each other.

Watched Tedx Talk on '7 Ways to Make Conversations with Anyone' at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I. Emphasizes skipping small talk, asking personal questions. This one wasn't too helpful.

Watched Elevator Pitch tutorials at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgCssZhVUUE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54. The key step seems to be, adding an element about why the other person should care. Three steps could include: 1) Who am I, what do I do. 2) Why should you care. 3) and what it is I want.
